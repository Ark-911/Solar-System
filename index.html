                <p class="mainp2">There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star. Our planetary system is called ‚Äúthe solar system‚Äù because we use the word ‚Äúsolar‚Äù to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis."</p>

                <p class="cont-sun">Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star ‚Äì a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, and without its energy, life as we know it could not exist here on our home planet.The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun‚Äôs volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. </p>

                <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. 
                    <br/>Because of Mercury's elliptical ‚Äì egg-shaped ‚Äì orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset.

                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth‚Äôs closest planetary neighbor. It‚Äôs one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it‚Äôs often called Earth‚Äôs twin because it‚Äôs similar in size and density.
                    <br/>It‚Äôs the hottest planet in our solar system üî•.Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) ‚Äì hot enough to melt lead.Venus rotates on its axis backward, compared to most of the other planets in the solar system. This means that, on Venus, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.

                    <br/>Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian soil oxidize, or rust, causing the soil and atmosphere to look red.Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide (CO2), argon (Ar), nitrogen (N2), and a small amount of oxygen and water vapor.
                    <br/>Mars has two moons named Phobos and Deimos.One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.

Jupiter‚Äôs iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.
                    <br/>Jupiter rotates once about every 10 hours (a Jovian day), but takes about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun (a Jovian year).Jupiter has more than 75 moons.

It is not the only planet to have rings ‚Äì made of chunks of ice and rock ‚Äì but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.
                    <br/>Saturn's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He).Saturn has 53 known moons with an additional 29 moons awaiting confirmation of their discovery‚Äîthat is a total of 82 moons.Saturn takes about 10.7 hours (no one knows precisely) to rotate on its axis once‚Äîa Saturn ‚Äúday‚Äù‚Äîand 29 Earth years to orbit the sun.

                <p>Uranus‚Äîseventh planet from the Sun‚Äîrotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.
                    <br/>Uranus is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were a large apple, Uranus would be the size of a basketball.Uranus has 27 known moons, and they are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.Uranus takes about 17 hours to rotate once (a Uranian day), and about 84 Earth years to complete an orbit of the Sun (a Uranian year).

                    <br/>Neptune has at least five main rings and four more ring arcs, which are clumps of dust and debris likely formed by the gravity of a nearby moon.
                    <br/>Neptune takes about 16 hours to rotate once , and about 165 Earth years to orbit the sun.Neptune has 14 known moons which are named after sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.

                        <p>Pluto is a complex world of ice mountains and frozen plains. Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto is the best known of a new class of worlds called dwarf planets.Pluto is about 1,400 miles (2,380 km) wide. That's about half the width of the United States, or 2/3 the width of Earth's moon.Pluto orbits the Sun about 3.6 billion miles (5.8 billion km) away on average, about 40 times as far as Earth, in a region called the Kuiper Belt.
                            <br/>A year on Pluto is 248 Earth years. A day on Pluto lasts 153 hours, or about 6 Earth days.Pluto has 5 moons. The largest, Charon, is so big that Pluto and Charon orbit each other like a double planet.Pluto‚Äôs surface is far too cold, -378 to -396 degrees F (-228 to -238 C), to sustain life as we know it ü•∂.

                        <p>Discovered in 1930, Pluto was long considered our solar system's ninth planet. But after the discovery of similar intriguing worlds deeper in the distant Kuiper Belt, icy Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.
                            <br/>In August 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) downgraded the status of Pluto to that of  ‚Äúdwarf planet.‚Äù This means that from now on only the rocky worlds of the inner Solar System and the gas giants of the outer system will be designated as planets.
